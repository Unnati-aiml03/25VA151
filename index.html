        Introduction: Oreo cookies were first developed by the National Biscuit Company (now known as Nabisco) in 1912 at their Chelsea Market factory in New York City. The first Oreo was sold on March 6, 1912, to a grocer in Hoboken, New Jersey.

        Oreo biscuits are iconic sandwich cookies consisting of two chocolate wafers filled with a sweet cream filling, first introduced in 1912 by Nabisco

        <h1>History</h1>
        <hr color="black"text-align='center'>
        The original design on the face of the Oreo featured a wreath around the edge of the cookie and the name "OREO" in the center.[18] In the United States, they were sold for $0.25 (equivalent to $8.15 in 2024) a pound (454 g) in novelty metal canisters with clear glass tops. The first Oreo was sold on March 6, 1912, to a grocer in Hoboken, New Jersey.


        The Oreo Biscuit was renamed in 1921 to "Oreo Sandwich";[9] in 1948, the name was changed to "Oreo Crème Sandwich"; and in 1974 it became the "Oreo Chocolate Sandwich Cookie",[9] the name that has remained to this day. A new design for the face of the cookie was launched in 1924;[18] the modern-day Oreo design was developed in 1952 by William A. Turnier,[20] incorporating the Nabisco logo. In 1920, a second lemon crème-filled variety of the Oreo was introduced, as an alternative to the white crème-filled variety, but this was discontinued in 1924[18] and the original flavor was the only version available for the next several decades

        he modern Oreo cookie filling was developed by Nabisco's principal food scientist, Sam Porcello,[15][22] who retired from Nabisco in 1993.[15] Porcello held five patents directly related to his work on the Oreo;[22] he also created a range of Oreo cookies that were covered in dark chocolate and white chocolate.[15][22] In the early 1990s, health concerns prompted Nabisco to replace the lard in the crème filling with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil.[23] This also made it possible for the bakery to become kosher-certified, a lengthy and expensive process for Nabisco.[24] Similarly, Oreo cookies are popular with people that have certain dietary restrictions, such as vegans, as the crème filling does not use any animal products.[25] However, there is still a risk of cross-contamination from other dairy-containing products made in the same production areas; in the FAQ section of the Oreo website, on the question of whether Oreo cookies are suitable for vegans, the response is "Many Oreo products are suitable for vegans but may include cross-contaminants of milk, so please check allergen advice.

        <h1>International distribution</h1>
        <hr color="black"text-align="center">
        Oreo cookies are distributed worldwide through a variety of sales and marketing channels. As their popularity continues to grow, so too does the amount of distribution that comes with it. According to the Kraft Foods company, the Oreo is the "World's Best Selling Cookie".[35] In March 2012, Time magazine reported that Oreo cookies were available in more than 100 countries. In 2012 it was estimated that, since the Oreo cookie's inception in 1912, over 450 billion Oreos had been sold worldwide;[19] just five years later, Mondelez reported that 40 billion -- nearly 10% of that 100-year quantity -- was now being produced worldwide annually.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3></h3>
        Oreos were first introduced into Britain through the supermarket chain Sainsbury's. For several years, this was the only supermarket chain in the UK to stock the Oreo until May 2008, when Kraft decided to fully launch the Oreo across the whole of the UK. Its packaging was redesigned into the more familiar British tube design, accompanied by a £4.5M television advertising campaign based around the "twist, lick, dunk" catchphrase.[36] In a 2020 national poll the Oreo was ranked the 16th most popular biscuit in the UK, with McVitie's chocolate digestive topping the list.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3></h3>
        In the UK, Kraft partnered with McDonald's to introduce the Oreo McFlurry (which was already on sale in several other countries, including the US) into McDonald's locations across the country during its annual Great Tastes of America promotions; in October 2015, the Oreo McFlurry then became a permanent menu item at McDonald's in the UK. An Oreo-flavored "Krushem" drink was also on sale in KFC stores across Britain.

        <h1>Production</h1>
        <hr color="black"text-align="centre">
        By 2017, more than 40 billion Oreo cookies were being produced annually in 18 countries around the world.[2] Oreo cookies for the Asian markets are manufactured in India,[40] Indonesia, Bahrain, and China.[42] Oreo cookies for the European market are made in Spain and at the Cadbury factory in the UK;[39] they are made in Russia (Mondelēz Rus) for consumers in several CIS countries;[44] and those sold in Australia are manufactured in Indonesia, China or Bahrain, depending on the flavor. The version produced in Canada (sold under the Christie's brand) included coconut oil but as of 2023, the ingredient list included vegetable oil and modified palm oil, similar to the American cookies.[45] Manufacture of Oreo biscuits began in Pakistan in early 2014, in collaboration with Mondelez International of the United States and Continental Biscuits Limited (CBL) of Pakistan, at the CBL production plant in Sukkur.

        Main article: Oreo boycott
In 2015, Mondelez announced its decision to close some of its American factories and move production to Mexico, prompting the Oreo boycott.[46] In 2016, after production had started in Mexico, the AFL–CIO encouraged the boycott and published consumer guidance to help identify which Mondelez products were made in Mexico.

        <h1>Variety  </h1>
        <hr color="black"text-align="center">
        In addition to their traditional design of two chocolate wafers separated by a crème filling, Oreo cookies have been produced in a multitude of different varieties since they were first introduced. This list is only a guide to some of the more notable and popular types; not all are available in every country. The main varieties in the United States are:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Double Stuf Oreo :</stronge> Introduced in 1974,[50] this variety has about double the normal amount of crème filling as the original. Available with various flavors of crème filling: original, chocolate, peanut butter, cool mint, and birthday cake. In the UK these are called Double Creme Oreos and are only available in original flavor. The Golden Double Stuf Oreo, featuring golden Oreo wafers with a double portion of original vanilla-flavored crème, was introduced in 2009.</li>
                
               
        </ul>
    </p>
    <hr>
<p>
    <h1>Ingredient</h1>
    <hr color="black"text-align="centre">
    The ingredients of Oreo cookies have remained largely unchanged from the original, although numerous alternative varieties and flavors have emerged over time. Oreo cookies were made with lard until the mid-1990s, when Nabisco swapped the animal fat with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. In the mid-2000s, Nabisco eliminated the partially hydrogenated oil from the ingredients, due to growing health concerns.[48] The classic Oreo cookie is made using 11 main ingredients:
    </p>
    <p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>sugar</li>
        <li>nbleached enriched flour (wheat flour, niacin, iron, thiamine mono-nitrate (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), folic acid)</li>
        <li>High oleic canola oil or palm oil</li>
        <li>Cocoa (treated with alkali)</li>
        <li>high fructose</li>
        <li>Leavening agents (baking soda and/or calcium phosphate)</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>Soy lecithin</li>
        
    </ol></p>
    <p>
        <h1>limited edition</h1>
        <hr color="black"text-align="centre">
        Beginning in the early 2010s, Nabisco began releasing limited edition runs of cookies with more exotic flavors. These typically appear in stores for a short period only, before being discontinued, although some varieties have since resurfaced, for example: Reese's Oreos returned for a second limited run after they were first introduced for a limited period in 2014; and Birthday Cake Oreos, originally introduced in 2012, have since become permanently available.[57] Some limited editions are only made available at certain retailers.
    </p>
    <p><h1></h1>
        
        Limited-edition runs usually feature a crème filling that has been flavored to replicate the taste of a specific fruit or dessert, from familiar flavors such as lemon or mint, to the more specific and unusual flavors of blueberry pie or red velvet cake. They may also incorporate different varieties of cookie wafer, for example Cinnamon-Bun Oreos featured cinnamon-flavored wafers and "frosting-flavored crème". In recent years, some limited editions have paired Oreos with other recognizable confectionery brands, including Reese's, Swedish Fish, and Peeps.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4></h4>
            Oreo's six-person team in charge of special flavors is extremely secretive; the company will not disclose even the group's name. The limited-edition flavors largely serve as advertising for Oreo's regular varieties:

        <h2>Use of the word "Oreo" as a slur</h2>
        <hr color="black"text-align="center">
        Oreo cookies, due to their almost-black cookies and white filling, have often been used in popular culture as a metaphor for relations between African Americans and White Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>Applied to a single person</h2>
        The term "Oreo" has occasionally been used as a racial slur aimed at a person of mixed-race or African-American heritage who is accused of trying to act white.[83][84][85][86] The insult may be levied as an accusation that the person perpetuates the "un-level playing field for blacks", and is based on the implication that the person is like the cookie, "black on the outside and white on the inside".[87] For example, the protagonist of the 1974 novel, Oreo, was nicknamed Oreo because of a mixed Jewish-American and African-American heritage.[88] Former American president Barack Obama, due to his biracial heritage, has been compared to an Oreo by political pundits and television personalities such as John McLaughlin and Rush Limbaugh.

This ad features two friends faced with the decision of whether to binge-watch a series or call it a night. Instead of arguing, they let an Oreo cookie decide their fate by twisting it. The commercial captures the spontaneity and joy that Oreo brings to everyday moments, showcasing the cookie as a fun decision-maker in life’s little dilemmas.
